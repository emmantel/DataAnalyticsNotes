# Data Analytics Notes

These are my notes from taking the Google Careers Data Analytics Course. Feel free to use as an overview of what the course covers or just as reference material.

I also added the code from my Capstone project for the code which was my first 'project' in R. The data I used is from https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-mapping#SLD and https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb.
